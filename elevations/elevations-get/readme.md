_Elevations Get_

***

## Concept

This is part of an investigation into writing very simple code that can access the [Google Maps API]( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial )


### Mission

* Obtain the latest most accurate 3D elevations as quickly and as easily as possible

### Vision

* Create digital terrain models for interesting new uses


## Features

* Obtain latitude and longitude for any location using Google Maps Geocoding
* Given latitude, longitude, zoom level, number of tiles per side, number of samples per side
	* App obtains - using Google Maps API - elevations for every sample
* Choose the quality of the data - can be sub-meter accurate where such data is available
* Respects Google's usage limits
* Tested to 
	* 250,000 elevations gathered in just over an hour.
	* 900 elevations in a few seconds
* Displays elevations in 3D in window
* Save data to a local file
* Reports on many aspects of the of the data 
* Save partial file and restart - much faster

## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the check box to display mesh as solid or wireframe
* Click the 'I' in the circle to go to the read me file
* Click on the title to reload the script
* Click the [Stats]( https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/ ) box in the top corner to toggle FPS / MS / MB views
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors



## Things you can do by editing the code

	https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-get/elevations-get-r9.js' width=800px height=600 ></iframe>

<input type=button onclick=window.location.href='https://github.com/jaanga/terrain3/tree/gh-pages/elevations/elevations-get/elevations-get-r9.js';
value='Source code listing' >


* Open this file: https://github.com/jaanga/terrain3/tree/gh-pages/elevations/elevations-get/elevations-get-r9.js
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor


## To Do / Wish List


* Add input tag to edit place name
* Add better height scaling system
* Drag map updates location
* Update 3D Display while drawing 
* Able to do 1000x1000 maps reliably and quickly
* Add ability to send directly to View Elevations 3D Display script in new tab

### Code




## Interesting sites

Fun possibilities for making new maps

* For family and friends
	* Maps of Armenia and China
* Gibralter
* Haiti
* Island Fernando de Noronha, brazil
* http://forums.simviation.com/
* Pythagoreio, Samos Prefecture, Greece
* BGBW Narsarsuaq Airport
* EGNS / isle of Man
* PHOG hawaii
* Walks KML data for Europe

## Issues

* meters per tile is broken


### Usage limits

The Google Maps Elevations API has strict [usage limits]( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/usage-limits ) for downloading elevations.

Figuring out how stay stay under the rate limits and yet be as fast as possible is an amusing challenge.
There seem to be a variety of speed bumps

* No more than 512 elevations in a single ask
* No more than 1000 elevations in under a second
* No more than ?? elevations in under a minute?
* No more than ?? elevations in under x minutes>
