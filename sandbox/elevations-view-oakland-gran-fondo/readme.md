* Each file has its own unique namespace JavaScript parent object
	* The object name also appears in the file name and in the folder name
	* You can identify the source and location of declaration for every function and variable just by looking at its name
		* Reduces the hunting through files to find the source
* Progress in building a template system
	* Each file has its own parent HTML file for viewing and testing in isolation
	* Each file can load any menu it needs at load time
	* Each file can manipulate the Three.js scene, after the scene has been created
	* All scheduling and callback handling carried out by simple, easy to understand functions
* Support four separate camera protocols
	* World camera: camera fixed at position in the air, follows nothing
	* Track camera: camera fixed at position on ground, follows actor
	* Chase camera: camera fixed inside actor, follows a point just ahead of the actor
	* Inside camera: camera fixed a distance from actor, follows actor position and rotation
* Slight temporary reduction in some feature
	* Old and new features to be introduced in the next few days
