[Elevations View Path Read Me]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/#sandbox/elevations-view-path-flight/ )
===

_Select a path to view from the menu on the left._


## Concept

Load and replay a path into the map and display it in 3D.

View an aircraft - moving along the path. The camera follow the aircraft.

While the camera is moving you may control the direction where it's looking.
