Hello Sun-lovers

As you know, I've been working on a simulation of a sunlight receiving system that's called 'Earth'.

These sims are often called 'maps'.

Here is a link to one of the best maps. Please do try to visit several of the locations. You might like the views of Diamond Head.

Elevations View   https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-view/

Here's a link to lots more links - the home page. Please see if you can navigate around the site.

jaanga terrain3 https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/

There are many possible useful scenarios. For example today I made a bunch of - incomplete - fixes to a flight simulator:

Elevations View Path  https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/sandbox/elevations-view-path/

Coming up will be blending in the Ladybug Web Solar Calculator and Analemma 3D.

So can we start coming up with some locations where a 3D solar 'sim' is useful? Villages in Ghana or Ecuador possibly?

May your ship come in on the sunny side of Easy Street,

Hi Everybody


My mission, as always, is to give peeps the tools to design their own fishing gear so they can catch their own fish so they have enough to eat. Replace fish with whatever.

Now I know you are not likely to design fishing gear, but you do eat fish.

If we are good fisherpeeps, then peeps like you have to able to command, savor and digest the results of our recipes.

This time its about the fishing maps.

Here is a link to one of the best maps - actually there's nothing fishy about it. Please do try to go to several of the locations.

[Elevations View]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-view/ )

And here is a link to lots more of the links. Please see if you can naviagate around.

[jaanga terrain3]( https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/ (

There's no need to report bugs yet. There's a ton of fishy things I already know about. 

If, however, there's a serious crash or freeze on your device then please do let me know.

And, there's no real need for wish list ideas yet either, as I have a ton of new ideas to fish for.

But what would be fun is thinking about the lure we put at the end of the fishing line.

So can you fish around your brain for a quote we could but on the web site that would be alluring?


 

## New peeps
Welcome message

Subject: Where would you like to go to?

Kindly have a look at two or three of the locations here:


And explore several of the links here:


What you will see is the prequel to the [perfection of the map]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science )

If you find this fun, then I would like to add you to the jaanga/terrain team. 

As a member you wilil receive updates by email and you can submit bug reports and much more
