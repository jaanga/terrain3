## Concept

Images or bitmap files used as heightmaps and/or overlays by the various Terrain scripts.

There's nothing much to play with here.

But instead of text, there should be a gallery here...


## Two samples

<img src="https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/bitmaps/Elevation.jpg" width="500px" >


_Elevations.jpg - 2048x1024 pixels - a typical file_


<img src="bathymetry_bw_composite_2k.png" width="500px" >

_bathymetry_bw_composite_2k.png_

Credits still to be added!
