## Change Log


### 2016-09-08 ~ R8

* Added/fixed toggles for:
	* AutoRotate, Fog, Sea level, Axis helper, Box helper
	* Added Fog wjich near and gar calculated by algorithm
* Position ground plane by algorithm
* Continue variable/namespace objectification
  
 
### 2016-09-07 ~ R7

* Complete rebuild
* JavaScript split into nine small files
* Each file has its own unique namespace JavaScript parent object
	* The object name also appears in the file name and in the folder name
	* You can identify the source and location of declaration for every function and variable just by looking at its name
		* Reduces the hunting through files to find the source
* Progress in building a template system
	* Each file has its own parent HTML file for viewing and testing in isolation
	* Each file can load any menu it needs at load time
	* Each file can manipulate the Three.js scene, after the scene has been created
	* All scheduling and callback handling carried out by simple, easy to understand functions
* Support four separate camera protocols
	* World camera: camera fixed at position in the air, follows nothing
	* Track camera: camera fixed at position on ground, follows actor
	* Chase camera: camera fixed inside actor, follows a point just ahead of the actor
	* Inside camera: camera fixed a distance from actor, follows actor position and rotation
* Slight temporary reduction in some feature
	* Old and new features to be introduced in the next few days
* Paths are displayed in three ways
	* Magenta line is the original TCX route of ~3,000 way points - full of twists and turns
	* Green line is a reduction of the path down to 300 points - takes out all the minor twists
		* This 'simple' line is used to create the highly visible path that you see
	* Yellow line is a spline that passes through the 300 points of the green line
		* You select how many points in the spline - from 200 to 4000
		* This line is the path for the camera
		* The camera stops at each point this determining the speed of the camera
			* The more the points/stops, the slower the camera proceeds
		* The default of 9,000 points gives a fairly smooth ride along the path

### 2016-09-01 ~ R6

* Settling down a bit

### 2016-08-19 ~ R4

* Added the four cameras
	* Took a while


### 2016-08-12 ~ R1

* First commit script and read me
* Add ability to acquire altitude for each 2D way point and turn into 3D
